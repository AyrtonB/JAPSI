  text: >-
    JA Professional Services has been providing consultancy services to the
    energy industry for over 30 years, with the last 10 focused on the renewable
    sector  


    In 2010 we were invited to provide consultancy services in the early stages of what was to become the world’s largest wind farm, something that we continue to be involved with during the operations & maintenance phase.


    In that time we have also provided services to other wind farms operators and shareholders, ranging from early stage planning through to O&M support.


    As the renewables industry has expanded and in particular the offshore wind industry has developed worldwide, we have become involved in multinational projects for international clients.
