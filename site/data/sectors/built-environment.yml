  We also support the design, construction and operating & maintenance phases of
  domestic dwellings constructed to be environmentally friendly, incorporating
  renewables generation technology, together with integrated feed-in/out of the
  UK Grid.


  This “new future” technology is designed to enable domestic dwellings to both reduce their environmental footprint and also aid the Grid by supporting frequency management and utilisation.
