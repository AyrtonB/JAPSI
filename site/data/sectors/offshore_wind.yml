  We have a wealth of experience within the offshore wind sector having been
  involved from the early days of offshore wind and with some of the world’s
  largest wind farms. Initially with fixed installation projects and more
  recently floating deepwater structures.


  Our work involves interfacing with Operator Shareholders, OFTO’s, Contractors and Manufacturers, together with numerous specialist consultants such as Marine Warranty, and also Consenting bodies such as the MMO.
