  Our teams have been responsible for one of the most extensive installations of
  inter-array and export cables at any offshore wind farm in the world, together
  with numerous major remediation projects, including complex replacement of
  inter-array cables during the operational phase of a major wind farm.


  We have also been involved with the complex analysis, design and installation of retrofit cable protection systems, fitted to failing cables. Such work being conducted within operational wind farms, with a key requirement being the need to minimise generation losses without impacting safety.
