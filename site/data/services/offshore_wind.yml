  We are able to provide project management and associated support services
  through all stages of a project. From the early phases of conceptual and
  front-end design into detailed design, manufacture and fabrication, through
  construction/installation and into commissioning, first generation and ongoing
  operations & maintenance.


  Our experience has also been honed during the execution of core projects whilst the wind farm is in operation, supporting the safety of simultaneous operations whilst minimising lost power production and ensuring that the project work scope is completed on time and to budget.
